TODO:
-----

 - Tests
 - Proper session handler
 - HTTPS
 - Check how many iterations bcrypt does per default, possibly up it.
 - look up XSS attacks on node how to protect. 
 - LAYOUT, card-loading (view files on server) - resource files are great but not queryable.
 - Add roles?
 - Add API endpoint for getting cards in year-range
 - Restructure Categories???
 - look over API structure - database to connect to etc.
 
 - tell tyler that api keys are storesd in the .js files used by config, and that these are never submitted to github, because these are also backend they are never exposed to users. When you need to look up things on user side, make it a call to server instead. only way i can think of to hide the information.

- Use errorhandler
